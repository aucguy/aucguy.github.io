I added the pause command to SPC. It allows for pausing of game-elements like mobs, tileentites (almost any block that contains items) and updating block neighbors (i.e. changing a block around sand makes the sand check if it needs to fall). You can get it [here](/projects/spc.html)

Edit March 28, 2017: Many grammer fixes
