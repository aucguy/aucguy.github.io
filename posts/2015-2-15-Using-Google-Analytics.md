title: Now using Google Analytics
category: main
---
I was wondering how many people visited my site so I added Google Analytics.
If you feel like yelling at me (and all other websites that use Google Analytics),
you can disable it [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

Note as of after the post: I don't bother to check Google Analytics Anyway, so I removed it.

Edit March 28, 2017: Many grammer fixes and removal status
