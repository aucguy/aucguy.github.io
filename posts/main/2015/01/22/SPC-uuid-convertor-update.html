	<div style="text-indent:3%;"><p>There is a new update for SPC. You can get it here <a href="/projects/spc.html">here</a>. This is a settings updater so SPC references settings by uuid (constant regardless of username changing)’s instead of usernames. If you’re running a server it is suggested you run this before February  4, 2015 (date of allowing username changed). This is important because with old versions of SPC if you changed your username <a href="https://mojang.com/2015/01/announcing-minecraft-name-changes/">(possible in the near future)</a> then you wouldn’t be able to access your old settings. For example, if your username was ‘foo’ then SPC would save your settings would be saved in a file named ‘foo.properties.’ But if you changed your username to ‘bar’ then SPC would expect your settings to be saved as ‘bar.properties’ But that doesn’t exist! So all your settings are lost. Instead if SPC referenced players by their uuids then this problem wouldn’t occur. When your username name was ‘foo’ your settings would be saved in a file named after your uuid. When you changed to ‘bar’ then your settings would still be saved in the same file since your uuid didn’t change. Basically, just get the update.</p>
