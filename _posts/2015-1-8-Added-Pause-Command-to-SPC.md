title: Added Pause Command to SPC
category: main
---
I added the pause command to SPC. It allows for pausing of game-elements like mobs, tileentites (almost everything that contains items) and updating block neighbors (i.e. changing a block to sand makes it check if it needs to fall). You can get it [here](/projects/spc.html)
