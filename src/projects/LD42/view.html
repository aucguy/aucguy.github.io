In this game you make pizza.

On the right there are ingredients.

To mix items, or to put items in pots and bowls, drag them ontop of one another. Note that you can't drag items ontop of the ingredients on the left.

Put tomatoes, pepper and flour into a pot to make tomato sauce which you then cook on the stove on the left. Put flour, water and yeast into a bowl to make dough which you then rise on the left right above the stove. Put the tomato sauce and dough together to make a sauce-only pizza. Then add cheese to make pizza and then put it in the oven. Finally sell the pizza by dragging it into the area on the top of the screen.

The bar on the top of an item says how well cooked it is. The bar on the bottom says how good the item is. The more well cooked items are upon mixing the better the resultant item is. Also, for tomato sauce and dough a green checkmark will indicate that it has all the ingredients. The better the pizza the more money you make.

You may also throw out items in the red zone.
